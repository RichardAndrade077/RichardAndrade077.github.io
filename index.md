## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 5

  Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it challenged me to understand initialization more. It helped push my abilities     to the next level. It made me feel accomplished

* Lab 8

  Lab 8, part 2 was one of my favorite lavs because it included loops which are difficult to understand at first but rewarding to       master. It was also cool to see how we could create a pattern using loops. I really felt like i challenged myself with this lab

* Lab 4

  Lab 4, part 2 was another of my favorite labs because it was the first time I was able to problem solve and understand exactly what   I was solving. It was an interesting lab in my opinion. I felt this lab challenged me appropriately.
